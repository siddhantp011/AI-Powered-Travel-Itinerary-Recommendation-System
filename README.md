The AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Recommendation System helps travelers generate personalized day-wise holiday plans based on their interests, trip duration, travel style, and destination preferences. It uses Machine Learning (TF-IDF Similarity) to match user interests with activity data and dynamically creates a travel itinerary.

- Objective -
To build a simple AI itinerary recommendation system that:
Understands traveler interests
Suggests location-specific activities
Automatically organizes them into a day-wise plan
Provides an intuitive interface for user interaction


- Technologies Used -
Category	Technology
Programming Language	Python
Web Framework	Streamlit
Machine Learning Method	TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
Data Format	JSON
Supporting Libraries	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn


- Machine Learning Model
Algorithm
. TF-IDF Vectorization
Converts text data (descriptions + categories + names) into numerical vectors representing relevance.

. Cosine Similarity
Calculates how closely the user interest matches each activity.


- Output Generation
  
Filter activities based on selected destination
Rank highest similarity first
Select top activities = Days × 3


- Arrange as a day-wise itinerary
